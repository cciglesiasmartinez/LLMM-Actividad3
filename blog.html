                        Apple's plans to add AI-powered search options to its Safari browser are a big blow to Google, whose
                        lucrative advertising business relies significantly on iPhone customers using its search engine.
                        The news slammed shares of Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O)
                        , opens new tab, which closed down 7.3%, wiping off roughly $150 billion from its market value.
                        The iPhone maker was "actively looking at" reshaping Safari, a source familiar with the matter told
                        Reuters, citing Apple (AAPL.O)
                        , opens new tab executive Eddy Cue who was offering testimony at an antitrust case on Wednesday over
                        Google's dominance in online search.
                        Cue said searches on Safari fell for the first time last month due to users increasingly turning to AI,
                        according to the source. Apple stock closed down 1.1%.
                        The commentary suggests that a seismic shift in search is likely underway, threatening Google's dominant
                        search business - a go-to advertising destination for marketers that has now become a target for U.S.
                        antitrust regulators, which filed two major lawsuits against the company.
                        Google is the default search engine on Apple's browser, a coveted position for which it pays the iPhone
                        maker roughly $20 billion a year, or about 36% of its search advertising revenue generated through the
                        Safari browser, analysts have estimated...

                            Android’s new design language looks extremely… Gen Z.

                            That much is obvious from the concept images in the leaked blog post that surfaced today (published by
                            Google, as it tends to do). While the theme is customizable, Google highlighted pink, purple, and coral
                            throughout the interface. It’s a decidedly younger, bubblier, and more fun design that screams “look at
                            all this fresh paint!” and less “choose from one of these six popular shades of blue.”...
