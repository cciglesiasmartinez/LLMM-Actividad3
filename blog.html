                        Apple's plans to add AI-powered search options to its Safari browser are a big blow to Google, whose
                        lucrative advertising business relies significantly on iPhone customers using its search engine.
                        The news slammed shares of Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O)
                        , opens new tab, which closed down 7.3%, wiping off roughly $150 billion from its market value.
                        The iPhone maker was "actively looking at" reshaping Safari, a source familiar with the matter told
                        Reuters, citing Apple (AAPL.O)
                        , opens new tab executive Eddy Cue who was offering testimony at an antitrust case on Wednesday over
                        Google's dominance in online search.
                        Cue said searches on Safari fell for the first time last month due to users increasingly turning to AI,
                        according to the source. Apple stock closed down 1.1%.
                        The commentary suggests that a seismic shift in search is likely underway, threatening Google's dominant
                        search business - a go-to advertising destination for marketers that has now become a target for U.S.
                        antitrust regulators, which filed two major lawsuits against the company.
                        Google is the default search engine on Apple's browser, a coveted position for which it pays the iPhone
                        maker roughly $20 billion a year, or about 36% of its search advertising revenue generated through the
                        Safari browser, analysts have estimated...

                    <p>
                        Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O)
                        , opens new tab on Tuesday forecast a $1.5 billion hit to revenue this year due to new U.S. curbs on
                        chips, which require the company to obtain a license to ship advanced artificial-intelligence processors
                        to China.
                        But it issued a second-quarter revenue forecast that topped Wall Street estimates, which analysts
                        attributed to customers buying more chips ahead of tariffs. Its shares were last up about 1% in
                        after-hours trading after rising as much as 6% and falling as much as 3.5%.
                        Under the Biden and Trump administrations, the U.S. has pursued increasingly aggressive curbs on AI chip
                        exports to China. These controls are aimed at hobbling China's ability to build advanced AI models and
                        applications that, according to the U.S., could have national security implications.
                        AMD CEO Lisa Su said on a conference call on Tuesday that most of the impact from the curbs would affect
                        the second and third quarters this year. Despite the new controls, Su said she expects AI chip revenue
                        from the company's data center business to grow this year by "strong double digits."
                        "It's certainly a headwind, but one which we think is well contained given everything else that we have
                        going on," she said...

                        In financial projections shared with investors, OpenAI said the percentage of revenue shared with
                        Microsoft would drop by at least half by the end of this decade, the report said.
                        In an existing deal, OpenAI has agreed to share 20% of its revenue with Microsoft through 2030, the
                        Information reported.
                        OpenAI told some potential and current investors that it would only share 10% of revenues with
                        commercial partners including Microsoft by 2030, the report said, citing private documents, adding that
                        Microsoft wants access to OpenAI's technology beyond 2030.
                        In January, Microsoft changed some key terms of a deal with OpenAI after its joint venture with Oracle
                        (ORCL.N)
                        , opens new tab and Japan's SoftBank Group (9984.T)
                        , opens new tab to build up to $500 billion of new artificial intelligence data centers in the United
                        States.
                        Microsoft has said it has "revenue sharing agreements that flow both ways" with OpenAI, with the key
                        elements of the partnership remaining in place for the duration of the contract through 2030.
                        "We continue to work closely with Microsoft, and look forward to finalizing the details of this
                        recapitalization in the near future," an OpenAI spokesperson told The Information.
                        Microsoft declined to comment on the report, while OpenAI did not immediately respond to a Reuters
                        request for comment outside regular business hours.

                    <p>
                        Android’s new design language looks extremely… Gen Z.

                        That much is obvious from the concept images in the leaked blog post that surfaced today (published by
                        Google, as it tends to do). While the theme is customizable, Google highlighted pink, purple, and coral
                        throughout the interface. It’s a decidedly younger, bubblier, and more fun design that screams “look at
                        all this fresh paint!” and less “choose from one of these six popular shades of blue.” Google’s blog
                        also confirms the push toward youth appeal. Fine; freshening up the interface every once in a while is a
                        good and necessary pursuit. Aside from the inherent cringe factor when a group of designers tries to
                        quantify youth appeal in bar graphs labeled “Coolness attributes,” I can’t shake the feeling that none
                        of this matters much against Android’s biggest hurdle in addressing the younger demographic: the iPhone.

                        Android is the most popular mobile operating system in the world. But here in the US, Apple owns a solid
                        majority of all phones sold. The numbers skew even more heavily toward iOS when you look at younger
                        demographics. A 2025 survey from investment bank Piper Sandler reports that 88 percent of teenagers
                        polled own an iPhone. A 2023 article in The Wall Street Journal found that kids who dared to bring an
                        Android phone to school faced teasing for using what is seen as a phone for old people. Google, it
                        seems, would like to do something about that...

                    <p>
                        Figma is expanding its creative software ecosystem to allow product designers to complete entire
                        projects without jumping to third-party apps. Four new products for website building, AI coding, branded
                        marketing, and digital illustration were introduced at Figma’s Config event today, aiming to fill in any
                        gaps holding Figma back from being an all-in-one platform that supports the entire product design
                        lifecycle.

                        For example, while existing products like Figma Design, Slides, and FigJam could be used to ideate and
                        create prototypes, developers would need to use services like WordPress to create live websites or Adobe
                        Illustrator to create customized and scalable brand imagery.

                        Figma’s first solution is Figma Sites, a website builder that integrates with Figma Design and allows
                        creators to turn their projects into live, functional sites. Figma Sites provides presets for layouts,
                        blocks, templates, and interactions that aim to make building websites less complex and time-consuming.
                        Additional components like custom animations can also be added either using existing code or by
                        prompting Site’s AI tool to generate new interaction codes via text descriptions, such as “animate the
                        text to fall into place like a feather...”

            <p>
                Microsoft has brought me inside the Surface hardware lab from time to time over the years, showing me
                how its engineers test the hinges and fabrics that go into its products. They’re usually typical
                engineering demonstrations, but last month I was invited to Microsoft’s headquarters in Redmond,
                Washington, to see how the company built its two new smaller Surface Pro and Surface Laptop devices. And
                this time around, I was pleasantly surprised to be shown how Microsoft uses magnets, robots, drop tests,
                and smoke to perfect its laptop and tablet designs.

                The first stop on the tour led me inside Microsoft’s advanced prototype center, where Surface engineers
                are constantly creating prototypes to refine the fit and finish on a new product like the Surface Pro
                12-inch. One of the new challenges for this device was getting the Surface Pen to attach to the rear of
                the tablet — and stay there...
