            <h2>Apple's plan to offer AI search options on Safari a blow to Google dominance</h2>
            <h6>Author: Aditya Soni and Jody Godoy</h6>
            <div class="artiImg"><img
                    src="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZJLPWE2C4JLSFEOMFPOALQSUY4.jpg?auth=689f712a4f464c7009244d351201b18bfd7ffb0a56ed7bb588360d4cf12ca27a&width=720&quality=80"

            <p>
                <!--This would be the head article of the day. (For Example)-->
                Apple's plans to add AI-powered search options to its Safari browser are a big blow to Google, whose
                lucrative advertising business relies significantly on iPhone customers using its search engine.
                The news slammed shares of Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O)
                , opens new tab, which closed down 7.3%, wiping off roughly $150 billion from its market value.
                The iPhone maker was "actively looking at" reshaping Safari, a source familiar with the matter told
                Reuters, citing Apple (AAPL.O)
                , opens new tab executive Eddy Cue who was offering testimony at an antitrust case on Wednesday over
                Google's dominance in online search.
                Cue said searches on Safari fell for the first time last month due to users increasingly turning to AI,
                according to the source. Apple stock closed down 1.1%.
                The commentary suggests that a seismic shift in search is likely underway, threatening Google's dominant
                search business - a go-to advertising destination for marketers that has now become a target for U.S.
                antitrust regulators, which filed two major lawsuits against the company.
                Google is the default search engine on Apple's browser, a coveted position for which it pays the iPhone
                maker roughly $20 billion a year, or about 36% of its search advertising revenue generated through the
                Safari browser, analysts have estimated.
                Banning Google from paying companies to be the default search engine is among the remedies that the U.S.
                Justice Department has proposed to break up its dominance in online search.
                "The loss of exclusivity at Apple should have very severe consequences for Google even if there are no
                further measures," D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria said.
                "Many advertisers have all of their search advertising with Google because it is practically a monopoly
                with almost 90% share. If there were other viable alternatives for search, many advertisers could move
                much of their ad budgets away from Google," Luria said.
                Google is not defenseless.
                Written off as an also-ran in the AI race by critics after ChatGPT's buzzy launch in late 2022, Google
                has reached into its deep pockets to fund its AI efforts and leverage its vast data trove.
                The company introduced an "AI mode" on its search page earlier this year, looking to retain its millions
                of users from going away to other AI models.
                It recently expanded AI Overviews - summaries that appear atop the traditional hyperlinks to relevant
                webpages on a search query - for users in more than 100 countries, and added advertisements to feature,
                boosting Search ad sales.
                CEO Sundar Pichai said in a testimony at an antitrust trial last month that Google hopes to enter an
                agreement with Apple by the middle of this year to include its Gemini AI technology on new phones.
                Apple's Cue on Wednesday also said the company would add AI search providers, including OpenAI and
                Perplexity AI, as search options in the future, Bloomberg reported.
                "(Apple's plan) also shows how far generative search sites, such as ChatGPT and Perplexity have come,"
                said Yory Wurmser, principal analyst for advertising, media & technology at eMarketer.
                That Google is willing to pay tens of billions of dollars to remain the default search engine shows how
                crucial the agreements are, Wurmser said.
                For instance, ChatGPT in April reported seeing over 1 billion weekly web searches. It has more than 400
                million weekly active users, as of February.

                    <h4>AMD forecasts $1.5 billion revenue hit from US curbs on China chip exports.</h4>
                    <h6>Author: Arsheeya Bajwa and Max A. Cherney</h6>
                    <div class="artiImg"><img
                            src="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GGS3YB2ZIFK4XFJIK7DSTK2LKI.jpg?auth=542982bd6b9213fa29336715edc3cce8116637c49e04eb0f24ec540921c6e050&width=640&quality=80"
                            alt="AMD chip on motherboard"></div>
                    <p>
                        Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O)
                        , opens new tab on Tuesday forecast a $1.5 billion hit to revenue this year due to new U.S. curbs on
                        chips, which require the company to obtain a license to ship advanced artificial-intelligence processors
                        to China.
                        But it issued a second-quarter revenue forecast that topped Wall Street estimates, which analysts
                        attributed to customers buying more chips ahead of tariffs. Its shares were last up about 1% in
                        after-hours trading after rising as much as 6% and falling as much as 3.5%.
                        Under the Biden and Trump administrations, the U.S. has pursued increasingly aggressive curbs on AI chip
                        exports to China. These controls are aimed at hobbling China's ability to build advanced AI models and
                        applications that, according to the U.S., could have national security implications.
                        AMD CEO Lisa Su said on a conference call on Tuesday that most of the impact from the curbs would affect
                        the second and third quarters this year. Despite the new controls, Su said she expects AI chip revenue
                        from the company's data center business to grow this year by "strong double digits."
                        "It's certainly a headwind, but one which we think is well contained given everything else that we have
                        going on," she said.
                        In April, AMD said it would record an $800 million charge from the new U.S. tariffs on chip exports to
                        China. On Tuesday, it forecast adjusted gross margin of 43%, which represents an 11 percentage-point
                        drop from the gross margin excluding the charge.
                        Like AMD, Nvidia (NVDA.O)
                        , opens new tab has also warned Wall Street that it will now need an export license to China. Nvidia
                        faces a $5.5 billion charge as a result.
                        China accounts for roughly a quarter of AMD's total revenue, and the impact of the export controls would
                        shave nearly 5% off the Wall Street forecast for revenue of $31.03 billion per LSEG data.
                        AMD finance chief Jean Hu said in the conference call following the results that the $1.5 billion
                        revenue hit for 2025 was due to the new round of export controls from April.
                        "The subtext is hard to miss; big hyperscalers would rather accelerate purchase order dates than risk
                        export‑license roulette once the latest China rules bite," said Michael Schulman, chief investment
                        officer at Running Point Capital.
                        "The flip side is that, once those safety‑stock closets are full, Q3 could feel like the morning after a
                        Red Bull binge ... keep one eye on backlog burn rates and another on Washington’s next tariff tweet," he
                        said.
                    <h4>GROWTH DESPITE CHINA</h4>
                    Still, the optimistic forecast shows that demand for AMD's advanced processors remains strong as they
                    power complex AI systems for Microsoft (MSFT.O)
                    , opens new tab, Meta Platforms (META.O)
                    , opens new tab and other customers. These cloud giants recently reinforced hefty spending plans for
                    building AI infrastructure.
                    On the conference call, Su said the company had not seen a lot of "tariff-related activity" in the first
                    quarter.
                    The company expects revenue of about $7.4 billion for the second quarter, plus or minus $300 million,
                    compared with analysts' average estimate of $7.25 billion.
                    In February, the company steered away from a practice of giving a specific sales forecast for its AI
                    chips, but Su had said AMD expects "tens of billions" of dollars in sales "in the next couple of years."
                    AMD reported data center sales jumped 57% to $3.7 billion, which topped estimates of $3.62 billion. The
                    company includes much of its AI hardware in its data center segment.
                    Total revenue jumped a better-than-expected 36% to $7.44 billion. Adjusted profit of 96 cents a share
                    was ahead of estimates by 2 cents a share.
                    Chip maker Marvell Technology (MRVL.O)
                    , opens new tab and server maker Super Micro (SMCI.O), opens new tab both disappointed investors on
                    Tuesday. Marvell pushed back a planned Investor Day to a later date in calendar 2026, citing the
                    uncertain economy, and Super Micro trimmed its 2025 revenue forecast, adding to concerns about its
                    position in the AI market. Marvell shares were down 4.5% after hours and Super Micro were down 5%.

                        In financial projections shared with investors, OpenAI said the percentage of revenue shared with
                        Microsoft would drop by at least half by the end of this decade, the report said.
                        In an existing deal, OpenAI has agreed to share 20% of its revenue with Microsoft through 2030, the
                        Information reported.
                        OpenAI told some potential and current investors that it would only share 10% of revenues with
                        commercial partners including Microsoft by 2030, the report said, citing private documents, adding that
                        Microsoft wants access to OpenAI's technology beyond 2030.
                        In January, Microsoft changed some key terms of a deal with OpenAI after its joint venture with Oracle
                        (ORCL.N)
                        , opens new tab and Japan's SoftBank Group (9984.T)
                        , opens new tab to build up to $500 billion of new artificial intelligence data centers in the United
                        States.
                        Microsoft has said it has "revenue sharing agreements that flow both ways" with OpenAI, with the key
                        elements of the partnership remaining in place for the duration of the contract through 2030.
                        "We continue to work closely with Microsoft, and look forward to finalizing the details of this
                        recapitalization in the near future," an OpenAI spokesperson told The Information.
                        Microsoft declined to comment on the report, while OpenAI did not immediately respond to a Reuters
                        request for comment outside regular business hours.

                    <h4>Android’s splashy new paint job won’t yank Gen Z from iPhones</h4>
                    <h6>Author: Allison Johnson</h6>
                    <div class="artiImg"><img
                            src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/Material-3-Expressive-leak-2.webp?quality=90&strip=all&crop=12.5%2C0%2C75%2C100&w=750"

                    <p>
                        Android’s new design language looks extremely… Gen Z.

                        That much is obvious from the concept images in the leaked blog post that surfaced today (published by
                        Google, as it tends to do). While the theme is customizable, Google highlighted pink, purple, and coral
                        throughout the interface. It’s a decidedly younger, bubblier, and more fun design that screams “look at
                        all this fresh paint!” and less “choose from one of these six popular shades of blue.” Google’s blog
                        also confirms the push toward youth appeal. Fine; freshening up the interface every once in a while is a
                        good and necessary pursuit. Aside from the inherent cringe factor when a group of designers tries to
                        quantify youth appeal in bar graphs labeled “Coolness attributes,” I can’t shake the feeling that none
                        of this matters much against Android’s biggest hurdle in addressing the younger demographic: the iPhone.

                        Android is the most popular mobile operating system in the world. But here in the US, Apple owns a solid
                        majority of all phones sold. The numbers skew even more heavily toward iOS when you look at younger
                        demographics. A 2025 survey from investment bank Piper Sandler reports that 88 percent of teenagers
                        polled own an iPhone. A 2023 article in The Wall Street Journal found that kids who dared to bring an
                        Android phone to school faced teasing for using what is seen as a phone for old people. Google, it
                        seems, would like to do something about that.

                        The screenshots from the blog post, which were saved by 9to5Google, give us a peek at what Google’s
                        attempt to appeal to the youth looks like. It builds on Material You, the interface that Google
                        introduced with Android 12, with a focus on customizability. It added the ability to change the
                        system-wide color palette based on your wallpaper, a feature that Apple more or less copied in iOS 18
                        with an option to tint homescreen icons. Material Three pushes even further, mixing in bold fonts,

                        Figma is expanding its creative software ecosystem to allow product designers to complete entire
                        projects without jumping to third-party apps. Four new products for website building, AI coding, branded
                        marketing, and digital illustration were introduced at Figma’s Config event today, aiming to fill in any
                        gaps holding Figma back from being an all-in-one platform that supports the entire product design
                        lifecycle.

                        For example, while existing products like Figma Design, Slides, and FigJam could be used to ideate and
                        create prototypes, developers would need to use services like WordPress to create live websites or Adobe
                        Illustrator to create customized and scalable brand imagery.

                        Figma’s first solution is Figma Sites, a website builder that integrates with Figma Design and allows
                        creators to turn their projects into live, functional sites. Figma Sites provides presets for layouts,
                        blocks, templates, and interactions that aim to make building websites less complex and time-consuming.
                        Additional components like custom animations can also be added either using existing code or by
                        prompting Site’s AI tool to generate new interaction codes via text descriptions, such as “animate the
                        text to fall into place like a feather...”

            <h3>How Microsoft shrunk its Surface devices</h3>
            <h6>Author: Tom Warren</h6>
            <div class="artiImg"><img
                src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/DSC00834.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0.094161958568733%2C100%2C99.811676082863&w=2400"

            <p>
                Microsoft has brought me inside the Surface hardware lab from time to time over the years, showing me
                how its engineers test the hinges and fabrics that go into its products. They’re usually typical
                engineering demonstrations, but last month I was invited to Microsoft’s headquarters in Redmond,
                Washington, to see how the company built its two new smaller Surface Pro and Surface Laptop devices. And
                this time around, I was pleasantly surprised to be shown how Microsoft uses magnets, robots, drop tests,
                and smoke to perfect its laptop and tablet designs.

                The first stop on the tour led me inside Microsoft’s advanced prototype center, where Surface engineers
                are constantly creating prototypes to refine the fit and finish on a new product like the Surface Pro
                12-inch. One of the new challenges for this device was getting the Surface Pen to attach to the rear of
                the tablet — and stay there.
